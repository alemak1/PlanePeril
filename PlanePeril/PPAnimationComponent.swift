/**  The player animations include propeller animations,which are based on fuel level.  The propeller seems to run slower for slower speeds and faster for faster speends, depending on the fuel level.  The textures used are the same, but the elapsed time between frames is different.  
 
 Likewise, enemy characters will have different animation speeds based on game difficulty level or level number.  These usually consist of faster spinning motions or faster flapping animations.
    
    The player can also have different animations for different animations states,such as a different levels of fading or colorization. The same holds true for enemies.  These damage animations are run independently of each other, so that a high-fuel, fast player can be in low or high damage state just like a low-fuel, slow-moving player can 
 
    
    In addition to optional movement (i.e. flapping) and damage (i.e. fadeIn/fadeOut) animations, enemy character may be following a path (such a circling in a given part of the screen, moving back and forth, moving along a closed path of connected points, etc)
